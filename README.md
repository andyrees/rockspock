# rockspock
Rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock

This was a fun twenty minutes, during a quiet moment in the office on Christmas Eve.

Daily Programmer Challenge
The challenge is to implement a basic game of Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock (to be called RPSLP for short). Your game will get the human choice. The computer AI will randomly pick a move. It will compare the results and display the moves and the out come (who wins or if a tie).

### Input
Get from the user their move being Rock, Paper Scissors, Lizard, Spock. Design and how you do it is up to you all.

### Output
Once the human move is obtained have the computer randomly pick their move. Display the moves back to the user and then give the results. Again the exact design is up to you as long as the output shows the moves again and the result of the game (who wins or if a tie).

Don't look at my code, if you want to take a crack at it yourself. :-)
